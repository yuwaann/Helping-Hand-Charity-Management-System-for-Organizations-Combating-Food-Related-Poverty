Helping Hand is an application created by a group of programmers to assist organizations in administering and arranging charitable events and organizations. The application loads organizations and events from the database and then provides capabilities such as donation addition and removal. The application also computes the total amount of donations, displays organizations' names, missions, and so on, displays events, and allows the user to register for such events.
